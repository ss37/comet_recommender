This started out as an assignment for my course on [Adaptive Information Systems](http://www.ischool.pitt.edu/ist/courses/descriptions.php#IS2480). I built a Java application that generated a list of recommended upcoming talks. Later, during the summer, I developed a Chrome extension and a RESTful web service to display these recommended list of talks on the browser.
