[CoMeT (Collaborative Management of Talks)](http://halley.exp.sis.pitt.edu/comet/index.do) is a website that allows users to announce or view announcements on various talks conducted in University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.
CoMeT allows users to bookmark talks, sync them with their iCal or Google Calendar, register the RSS feeds for upcoming talks. It also syncs with social sites like Twitter and Facebook and allows users to know (based on the bookmarks) how popular a talk would be.
